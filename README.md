Any spoken text is shown in a dialogue box. You can see visual models of the characters above the dialogue box which are highlighted and 
enlarged to represent who is talking. At any time users can skip the typewriter effect by pressing the space key. 
When the current dialogue is finished, an arrow button will appear at the bottom right of the dialogue box to move on. 

# choice
Certain dialogue however will prompt choices from the user to interact with the story. To pick a choice, the user will type the number of the choice and press enter.  
If the number entered is invalid the user is given a invalid input message.
The dialogue only continues when the choice is picked. Some choices will annoy the character the player is talking to. 
# Annoyance
If the annoyance bar is raised to the max, the game will end as the character storms off. 

Once the story is over, the game will bring the user back to the menu.
